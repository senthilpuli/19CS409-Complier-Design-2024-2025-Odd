# RECOGNITION OF A VALID ARITHMETIC EXPRESSION THAT USES
## Register Number : 212222220041
## Date : 10.11.2024

## AIM   
To write a yacc program to recognize a valid arithmetic expression that uses operator +,- ,* and /.

## ALGORITHM
1.	Start the program.
2.	Write a program in the vi editor and save it with .l extension.
3.	In the lex program, write the translation rules for the operators =,+,-,*,/ and for the identifier.
4.	Write a program in the vi editor and save it with .y extension.
5.	Compile the lex program with lex compiler to produce output file as lex.yy.c. eg $ lex filename.l
6.	Compile the yacc program with yacc compiler to produce output file as y.tab.c. eg $ yacc â€“d arith_id.y
7.	Compile these with the C compiler as gcc lex.yy.c y.tab.c
8.	Enter an arithmetic expression as input and the tokens are identified as output.

## PROGRAM
```
 %{
/* This LEX program returns the tokens for the expression */
#include "y.tab.h"
%}
%%
"=" {printf("\n Operator is EQUAL");}
"+" {printf("\n Operator is PLUS");}
"-" {printf("\n Operator is MINUS");}
"/" {printf("\n Operator is DIVISION");}
"*" {printf("\n Operator is MULTIPLICATION");}
[a-zA-Z]*[0-9]* {
printf("\n Identifier is %s",yytext);
return ID; }
. return yytext[0];
\n return 0;
%%
int yywrap()
{
return 1;
}
```

## RESULT
A YACC program to recognize a valid arithmetic expression that uses operator +,-,* and / is executed successfully and the output is verified.
